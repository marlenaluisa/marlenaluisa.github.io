			<h2>Me</h2>
				<p>Becca is the life of the party always. Whether it is the weekend or classtime I am 
always on. Planning does not work for me and I do not care about practicalities. I live
in the now and that is the way I will always be. My parents approve of everything I do
because they have been enablers my whole life but it would not matter if they did not
approve because who cares what parents think. If you are looking for a hype-girl, call 
me first and I will be there. <br> I am also extremely athletic. Ask any coach who has
ever had the pleasure of coaching me and they will tell you I am something else. Hiking
and backpacing are my specialties but I am pretty much good at everything.</p>

			<h2>Wanderer</h2>
				<p>I always have great stories to tell and of course they are all lies but no one is going to 
question me because all of my stories are far fetched and I have photographic proof 
of all of my endeavors. None of the pictures are real but I am pretty good with photoshop 
so everyone believes it. Some of my stories are totally real but I cannot say them and that is because I
go on tons of cool adventures but if I told you about them I would have to kill you.</p>
