			<h3>Spain</h3>
				<p>This one time my family went to Spain to visit my sister when she was
				 studying abroad and it was the craziest vacay ever! We flew in and I had
				 to converse with the natives because I am 
				 <strong>VERY</strong> fluent Spanish speaker. We found my sister due to my
				 <em>expertise</em> and went on our way. Once we had eaten dinner, paella
				 of course, we all went to bed. <strong>PSYCH</strong>. My sister and 
				 I hit up the discotechas to party the night away. We danced until 4:00am
				 when my sister realized she no longer had her phone!</p>
				 <p>Enter: ME. I looked around and saw some guy lurking in the outskirts 
				 of the club with a jacket over his arms, a dead giveaway for pitpockets. 
				 Before he even knew what was happening I tackled him and long story short, 
				 at least ten people got their iPhones and wallets back. As you can see, 
				 Spain loves me.
				 </p>
			<h3>Hawaii</h3>
				<p> One of my dreams has always been to go hiking in Hawaii and last summer
				I did just that! It was amazing I made it to every island in just seven 
				days and saw everything there was to see. I was the one who planned everything
				so everything went according to plan! I loved having everyone follow me around
				like I was some sort of tour guide in a place I had never even been to. I
				guess confidence goes a long way in terms of validity and experience.
