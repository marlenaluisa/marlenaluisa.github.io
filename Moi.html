			<h2>Epic Commercial</h2>
			<p> I bet you did not know that I was featured in a commercial once for this
			super hipster popcorn brand named Jiffy Pop. Here is the video in case you are
			interested.</p2>

			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p2>I love Adventuring and I am a big sports girl, I love entertaining others
			and spontaneous joke telling. I love this world and I love traveling! All throughout
			my website there are videos and pictures and stories of my travels. </p2>
			<p2> Something most people do not know about me is that I am an expert in 
			reading mountain trails. I can just feel the trail and know where I need to go.
			There is nothing greater than the feeling when you get to the top of a mountain 
			and you just breathe. You breathe into lungs that have been opened up and abused 
			during the brutal ascent, but once you are in that open air, it just feels pure. 
			Your mind clears and everything feels at ease. That is my favorite time to eat an 
			orange. You are thirsty and tired when you get to the top so you open up that 
			orange and let  the juices run down your chin. The natural sugar gives you a 
			good boost of energy for the climb down. 
			These are few of my favorite things. 
			</p2>
			<h2>Special Talents</h2>
				<p2>I am kind of an experienced chef when it comes to TV dinners. Name any Campbells 
premade soups and I can tell you how long they need to be microwaved for. I make
cereal the perfect way, milk first of course. When I want to get really fancy. I splurge
and get Annie's Organic White Cheddar Shells Mac n Cheese and it is incredible. You add
lots of butter to the cheese sauce and half an avocado, sliced, over the top of the whole
thing. Let me tell you, it is a thing of beauty, my friend. You could say I am pretty
culinarily inclined but I think it was my ability to read that really helped me in my successes. </p2>
